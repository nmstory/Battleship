# Battleship
Based around the original childhood game Battleship, created by Hasbro.

This project was started after my First Year at university to keep my Java skills up with a strong emphasis on Object Orientation, but is very much a work in progress.

DONE:
* Create a player
* Player is able to select the location of various ships on an 8x8 grid, receiving an alert if the chosen path crosses the        edge or another ship
* Resulting Grid is then shown to player
* Can play against another player, or AI

PLANS:
* Turn based system to play
* Use the Swing framework to create a simple GUI

BATTLESHIP 2.0:
* Play with AI
